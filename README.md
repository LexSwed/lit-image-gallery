## Todo

- [ ] Safari on iOS seems to throttle `scrollIntoView` while scrolling (waits until finger is up ðŸ¤·)
- [ ] Figure out support for styling `slotted` `<picture><source><img /></picture>`, in Shadow DOM only direct children can be styled
  - Proposed solution is to introduce `<image-gallery-image>` which can accept `<img>` and `<picutre>` without issues because styles will be applied on `:host`
- [ ] Slots for nudge buttons, switching images automatically on clicks
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Many different styling and framework usages examples
